# Virtual Machine Instruction Set Specification

## Introduction

When finalizing an instruction set for a virtual machine (VM), it's crucial to cover all necessary computational scenarios while balancing simplicity and security. This document outlines a proposed instruction set for a VM designed to execute smart contracts within a blockchain environment.

## Arithmetic Operations

- `ADD`: Pop two values from the stack, add them, and push the result.
- `SUB`: Pop two values from the stack, subtract them, and push the result.
- `MUL`: Pop two values from the stack, multiply them, and push the result.
- `DIV`: Pop two values from the stack, divide them, and push the result.
- `MOD`: Pop two values from the stack, calculate the modulus, and push the result.

## Bitwise Operations

- `AND`: Pop two values from the stack, perform bitwise AND, and push the result.
- `OR`: Pop two values from the stack, perform bitwise OR, and push the result.
- `XOR`: Pop two values from the stack, perform bitwise XOR, and push the result.
- `NOT`: Pop one value from the stack, perform bitwise NOT, and push the result.
- `SHIFT_LEFT`: Pop a value and a shift amount from the stack, shift left, and push the result.
- `SHIFT_RIGHT`: Pop a value and a shift amount from the stack, shift right, and push the result.

## Comparison Operations

- `EQ`: Pop two values, push 1 if they are equal, else 0.
- `GT`: Pop two values, push 1 if the first is greater than the second, else 0.
- `LT`: Pop two values, push 1 if the first is less than the second, else 0.

## Control Flow

- `JUMP`: Pop an address from the stack, jump to that address in the code.
- `JUMP_IF`: Pop a condition and an address, if the condition is true, jump to the address.
- `CALL`: Call a subroutine at an address.
- `RET`: Return from a subroutine.

## Stack Operations

- `PUSH`: Push a value onto the stack.
- `POP`: Pop a value from the stack.
- `DUP`: Duplicate the top value on the stack.
- `SWAP`: Swap the top two values on the stack.

## Memory Operations

- `LOAD`: Pop an address, push the value at that address.
- `STORE`: Pop a value and an address, store the value at the address.
- `ALLOCA`: Allocate memory without initialization.

## Specialized Blockchain Instructions

- `CRYPTO_HASH`: Pop a value, push its cryptographic hash.
- `CHECK_SIG`: Pop a signature and a public key, push 1 if the signature is valid, else 0.
- `CREATE_CONTRACT`: Create a new smart contract and push its address.
- `CALL_CONTRACT`: Call an existing contract.
- `SEND_TRX`: Pop a value and an address, send the value to the address.
- `GAS_LIMIT`: Push the remaining gas onto the stack.

## Gas and Fee Management

- `SET_GAS`: Set the amount of gas for the next instruction.
- `GAS`: Push the amount of gas consumed by the current instruction.

## Miscellaneous

- `NOOP`: A no-operation instruction, does nothing.
- `HALT`: Stop execution and exit the VM.

## Environmental Information

- `BLOCKHASH`: Obtain the hash of a block in the blockchain, which can be used for randomness in contracts.
- `COINBASE`: Get the address of the block miner.
- `TIMESTAMP`: Push the current block timestamp.
- `BLOCKNUMBER`: Push the current block number.
- `DIFFICULTY`: Push the current block difficulty.
- `GASLIMIT`: Push the current block gas limit.

## Error Handling

- `ASSERT`: Pop a value and halt execution if the value is not true, indicating an assertion failure.
- `REVERT`: Stop execution and revert state changes, refunding the remaining gas.
- `THROW`: Signal an unhandled exception, stop execution, and revert state changes without refunding gas.

## System Operations

- `SLOAD`: Load data from blockchain storage.
- `SSTORE`: Save data to blockchain storage.
- `SELFDESTRUCT`: Destroy the contract and send remaining funds to a specified address.

## Advanced Arithmetic

- `EXP`: Pop two values, calculate the exponentiation, and push the result.
- `ADD_MOD`: Pop three values, calculate the addition with modulus, and push the result.
- `MUL_MOD`: Pop three values, calculate the multiplication with modulus, and push the result.

## Cryptographic Functions

- `ECRECOVER`: Recover the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error.
- `SHA3` or `KECCAK256`: Calculate the Keccak-256 hash of data.

## Contract Management

- `DELEGATECALL`: Like `CALL`, but the called contract code executes with the caller's context.
- `STATICCALL`: Perform a call without allowing state modifications.

## Log Operations

- `LOG`: Append a log entry to the blockchain, which is crucial for smart contracts to emit events.

## Memory Management

- `MLOAD`: Load a word from memory.
- `MSTORE`: Store a word in memory.
- `MSTORE8`: Store a byte in memory.
- `MSIZE`: Push the size of active memory.

## Advanced Control Flow

- `JUMPDEST`: Mark a valid destination for jumps.
- `PC`: Push the program counter to the stack.

## Conclusion

Each instruction in this extended list should be carefully designed with clear operational semantics, including preconditions, postconditions, and effects on the gas metering. They should also be rigorously tested to ensure they behave as expected in all edge cases.

By including these additional instructions, we can provide a richer set of capabilities for smart contract developers, enabling more complex and feature-rich applications while maintaining the overall integrity and security of the VM. Itâ€™s crucial, however, to strike a balance between providing a rich feature set and maintaining the VM's performance and security.
